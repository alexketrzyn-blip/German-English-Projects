Bilingual Technical Presentation

This repository documents a bilingual instructional design project created during an English lesson with a German engineer working in the medical equipment industry. The project focused on preparing the student (language level B1) for a real company meeting where he had to present technical issues and proposed solutions in English.

##  Project Context
- **Student profile:** German engineer, B1 English level.
- **Industry:** Medical technology – mobile CT scanners mounted on truck trailers.
- **Lesson goal:** Prepare the student to deliver a clear, structured presentation in English during a company meeting.

##  Technical Problem
The company faced a critical safety issue:
- Inadequate shielding of mobile CT scanner trailers.
- Radiation leakage through structural gaps in the protective cage.
- Risks for bystanders, especially patients with implanted medical devices (e.g., pacemakers).

##  Student’s Presentation Tasks
During the meeting, the student was expected to:
1. **Describe the problem** – explain radiation leakage and its risks.
2. **Propose solutions** – improved shielding, external sensors, safety zones, patient protection measures.
3. **Engage in discussion** – respond to colleagues’ alternative solutions and defend his own proposals.

##  Instructional Approach
- We practiced **technical vocabulary** and **presentation skills** in English.
- The student rehearsed **problem–solution structure** and **discussion readiness**.
- Materials were prepared in **both German and English** to support comprehension and bilingual communication.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `Scanner DE.docx` – German project description with technical problem and solutions.
- `Safety Improvements for Mobile CT Scanner Units.pptx` – English presentation prepared for the company meeting.

##  Project Significance
This project demonstrates:
- **Instructional design** for technical communication at B1 level.
- **Technical writing** in both German and English.
- **Practical application**: the student successfully used the presentation in a real company meeting.
